# 🤖 Introduction
Uber Clone is a feature-rich mobile app built using React Native for the user interface, Google Maps for real-time navigation and directions, and Stripe for seamless payment processing. The app's back-end is powered by a serverless Postgres database, ensuring scalable and high-performance data management. Styled with TailwindCSS, it offers a modern and responsive UI. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the development of full-stack mobile applications, highlighting the my ability to deliver innovative and impactful solutions.
